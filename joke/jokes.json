Third guy smiles triumphantly and says \"My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth.\" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.   The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.    Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going.  First guy is ecstatic: \"I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.\"  Second guy smiles and says \"Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.\"   Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:    \"Guys, I think I fucked up.\""

My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.   As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said,  \"Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!\"  It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, \"You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.\"   I said, \"Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!\"  We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go.   She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table.  We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

One evening the old farmer decided to go down to the pond, as he hadn't been there for a while, and look it over. He grabbed a five-gallon bucket to bring back some fruit. As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee. As he came closer, he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond.  He made the women aware of his presence and they all went to the deep end. One of the women shouted to him, 'we're not coming out until you leave!'  The old man frowned, 'I didn't come down here to watch you ladies swim naked or make you get out of the pond naked.'  Holding the bucket up he said, 'I'm here to feed the alligator...'

After trying his keys on five others, he finally found his own vehicle.  He sat in the car a good 10 minutes as the other pub patrons left.  He turned his lights on, then off.  He started to pull forward into the grass, then stopped.  Finally, when his was the last car, he pulled out onto the road and started to drive away.  The cop, waiting for this, turned on his lights and pulled the man over.  He administered the breathalyzer test and, to his great surprise, the man easily passed.  The cop was dumbfounded.

While waiting for the light to change, an frail looking old man on a yellow moped pulls up next to him. The old man looks over at the Ferrari and asks, \"What kind of car ya' got there, Sonny?\"   The young man replies, \"A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!\"   \"Wheeewee... that's a lot of money,\" says the old man as he tucks his thumbs up against his suspenders. \"Why does it cost so much?\"   \"Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!\" states the banker proudly.   The moped driver asks, \"Mind if I take a look inside?\"   \"No problem,\" replies the proud new owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around at all the bells and whistles lining the dashboard. Sitting back on his moped, the old man whistles and says, \"That's a pretty nice car, all right... but I'll stick with my moped!\"   Just then the light changes, so the banker decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph! Suddenly, he notices a yellow dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be, and suddenly... Whoooooosssshhhhh! Something blows by him, going much faster!   \"What in the hell could be going faster than my Ferrari?\" the young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. Whoooooosssshhhhh!   He's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Dumbfounded, the banker floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again!   The Ferrari red lines and there's nothing more he can do! Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end. The young man stops and jumps out, and unbelievably, the old man is still alive. He runs up to the mangled old man and says, \"Oh my God! Is there anything I can do for you?\" The old man whispers with his dying breath... \"Unhook... my... suspenders... from... your.... side view mirror.\""

The sheriff figures even a short stay in jail will be plenty after a little \u201cjustice\u201d from the townspeople.  The sheriff takes the criminals to the town square, handcuffs them posts and sets up shop. He tells the people that the punishment should fit the crime so anyone can pay $1 to kick the rapist in the groin. Since the con artist used his image to wrong his victims, anyone can pay $1 to hit him in the face.  After a while there are two long lines for the criminals. Some people paying $5, $10, even $15 to get their licks in. After a long while, a guy steps up for his turn and sees the con artist\u2019s face is a bloody pulp and thinks \u201cHe\u2019s so beat up at this point, he probably can\u2019t even feel anything anymore.

None of the apartments in this complex have air-conditioning. It's close to midnight, December in Sydney AUS, it's a hot humid night.   **Story:** With the heat and humidity I was finding it very hard to sleep, and had taken to watching some Japanese horror flicks on my laptop to kill some time. I had my headphones on since I needed to open all the bedroom windows (thanks to the heat) and I didn't want to disturb my neighbours. At a poignant part of the story in the movie, I could hear over the sound track a slow rhythmic masculine groan. After about a minute of confusion I realised that some of my neighbours were enjoying some casual coital union. The rhythmic groan picked up in frequency and amplitude, and was soon offset with his partners feminine \"yes\"es. Needless to say, I was no longer watching my horror movie and I was laughing hysterically, yet quietly, at this point into my pillow.  Quickly their coital activities got to a point of \"fever pitch\" where the male neighbour announced, \"I'm gonna cum, I'm gonna cum!\" to which the female neighbour demands he \"wait, and cum on my face!\". Cue a series of climatic groaning and other such sounds of affirmation.  Job done, the female announces that she's heading off to have a shower (good call) and goes to the bathroom to do so. All the windows are open it seems, as one can hear all the associated sounds of a shower hard earned.   Upon her arrival back into the bedroom the female scolds her counterpart for lighting up and enjoying a cigarette in her absence,  stating \"Dammit you know that ciggie smoke irritates my sinuses!\". Shortly after this statement, she sneezes loudly and impressively. At this point I turn towards my open window and say in a nice loud voice \"Bless you!\"...  ..Silence...  ...An embarrassed scream.  ...And a Guinness World Record attempt in the number of windows closed in the shortest period of time possible.   I nearly pissed myself laughing."

The priest agrees and after a few minutes of fondling he finds himself with a pretty serious erection. 'You know, sister, if I introduce my penis in the right place, it can give life.'

A priest comes by, stops and watches throngs of people giving money to the beggar sitting behind the cross, but none give to the beggar sitting behind the Star of David. Finally, the priest goes over to the beggar behind the Star of David and says: \"Don't you understand? This is a Catholic country. People aren't going to give you money if you sit there with a Star of David in front of you, especially if you're sitting beside a beggar who has a cross. In fact, they would probably give to him just out of spite!\"  The beggar behind the Star of David listened to the priest, turned to the other beggar with the cross and said: \"Moshe, look who's trying to teach the Goldstein brothers about marketing!\""

The Queen nods in assent, saying \"you do not have the look of a man who could please his mistress when you hold her naked in your arms. For your beard is little more than the kind of fuzz that ladies have in certain places, and it is easy to tell from the state of the hay whether the pitchfork is any good.\"  On his turn, the knight asks \"Lady, answer me without deceit. Is there hair between your legs?\" When she replies, \"none at all\", he comments, \"Indeed I do believe you, for grass does not grow on a well-beaten path.\""

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.   Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.   He made it out, but a single person died.   Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.   He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.   When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.   After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.   The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.  The man was perfectly fine.  Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.   And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.   Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.   Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.   The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.   For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.   After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.  The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.  Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.   And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.   To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.   And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.   On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.  \"You know what? No,\" said the executioner. \"I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.\"   Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.   The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.   The executioner was speechless.  The man looked at the executioner and said \"Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.\""

The teacher asks Mr Trump if he would like to lead the discussion of the word \"tragedy.\" So he asks the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stands up and offers: \"If my best friend who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that would be a tragedy.\" \"No,\" says Mr Trump, \"that would be an accident.\" A little girl raises her hand: \"If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.\" \"I'm afraid not,\" explains the exalted businessman. \"That's what we would call a great loss.\" The room goes silent. No other children volunteer. Mr Trump searches the room. \"Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?\" Finally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says: \"If a private jet carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.\" \"Fantastic!\" exclaims Mr Trump, \"That's right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?\" \"Well,\" says the boy, \"because it sure as hell wouldn't be a great loss and it probably wouldn't be an accident either.\""

There are three shelves in the bedroom, with hundreds and hundreds of cute, cuddly teddy bears carefully placed in rows, covering the entire wall!   It was obvious that he had taken quite some time to lovingly arrange them and she was immediately touched by the amount of thought he had put into organizing the display.   There were small bears all along the bottom shelf, medium-sized bears covering the length of the middle shelf, and huge, enormous bears running all the way along the top shelf.   She found it strange for an obviously masculine guy to have such a large collection of teddy bears.  She is quite impressed by his sensitive side, but doesn't mention this to him.    They share a bottle of wine and continue talking and,   After awhile, she finds herself thinking,    'Oh my God! Maybe, this guy could be the one!   'Maybe he could be the future father of my children?'    She turns to him and kisses him lightly on the lips.   He responds warmly.   They continue to kiss, the passion builds.   And he romantically lifts her in his arms and carries her into his bedroom,  where they rip off each other's clothes and make hot, steamy love.  She is so overwhelmed that she responds with more passion, more creativity, more heat than she has ever known.  After an intense, explosive night of raw passion with this sensitive guy,  they are lying there together in the afterglow. The woman rolls over, gently strokes his chest and asks coyly,   'Well, how was it?'   The guy gently smiles at her,  strokes her cheek,  looks deeply into her eyes,        and says:     'Help yourself to any prize from the middle shelf.'"

When she's with a few guy friends two days later, Paula asks them about it.  \"Do you guys ever do that?\" she asks.  \"Sure, all the time,\" her friend says.  \"Really, you masturbate into condoms?\" she responds.  \"Oh, no!

    "part2": "This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years. The only friction in their marriage was the husband's habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke.  The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.  Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor. She was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out.  The years went by and he continued to rip them out! Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her.  She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts.  Some time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom.  The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good.  About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his bloodstained underpants with a look of horror on his face.  She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, \"Honey, you were right. All these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you.  \"What do you mean?\" asked his wife.  \"Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God, some Vaseline, and these two fingers, I think I got them all back in."

'$165,000' she answered, and poured the bank notes from her bag on the table.  Obviously, the president got really curious about the origin of all this money, so he asked where the cash came from.  'Gambling' she muttered.  'What kind of gambling?' the president asked.  'Bets. Let me give you a real example. I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are rectangular.'  'Hahaha. That's a stupid bet. You could never win.'  'Would you care to accept the bet, then?' asked the elderly woman in a challenging tone.  'Of course! I'll bet $25,000 that my balls aren't rectangular!'  'Since it's such a large sum, would it be possible for me to return tomorrow morning with my attorney as our witness?'  'Sure' said the president of the bank in an extremely satisfied tone.  That night, the president actually got scared because of the bet. He spent quite some time in front of the mirror, checking his balls, turning them to the left, to the right, and to the left again. He meticulously inspected them to make 100% sure his balls weren't rectangular so he could win the bet.  The next morning, the elderly woman entered the president's office with her lawyer. She introduced the latter to the president and repeated the bet.  'So $25,000 that the president's balls are rectangular!'  The president accepted the bet once again, then the little old woman asked him to lower his pants so they could all see his balls. The president complied. The elderly woman inspected his balls really closely, then inquired whether she could touch them, which the president accepted... after all, he had the opportunity to win $25,000!  That's when he noticed the woman's lawyer started to bang his head against the wall.  'What's the problem with your attorney, m'am?'  'Oh, nothing. Only that yesterday I bet him $100,000 that today I'd hold the president of the Canadian National Bank's balls in my hand.'"

He falls flat on his face. \"Shoite\" he says and pulls himself up by the stool and dusts himself off. He takes a step towards the door and falls flat on his face. \"Shoite, Shoite!\" He looks to the doorway and thinks to himself that if he can just get to the door and some fresh air he'll be fine. He belly crawls to the door and shimmies up to the door frame. He sticks his head outside and takes a deep breath of fresh air, feels much better and takes a step out onto the sidewalk. He falls flat on his face. \"Bi'Jesus... I'm tanked,\" he says. He can see his house just a few doors down, and crawls to the door and shimmies up the door frame, opens the door and shimmies inside. He takes a look up the stairs and says \"No way!\" He crawls up the stairs to his bedroom door and says \"If i can just make it to me bed.\" He takes a step into the room and falls flat on his face. He says \"to hell with it\" and falls into bed. The next morning, his wife, Jess, comes into the room carrying a cup of coffee and says, \"Get up Paddy. Did you have a bit to drink last night?\". Paddy says, \"I did Jess. I was tanked' pissed. But how'd you know?\" \"Mick called. You left y'wheelchair at the pub.\""

Saint Peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.  \"So, you're a politician...\" \"Well, yes, is that a problem?\" \"Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!\"  \"Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??\" says the politician. \"Them's the rules\" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears... And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?  \"Open your eyes!\" says a voice. \"C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!\". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. \"Who are you??\" The politician asks. \"Well, I'm Satan!\" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. \"Welcome to Hell!\" \"Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?\" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. \"Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside...\" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. \"It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!\" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep... And is woken up by St Peter. \"So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?\" \"No sir!\" says the man. \"So then\" says St Peter \"you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on\". \"Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell\" says the politician. \"Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!\" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.  The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. \"What's this??\" He cries. \"Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???\"  \"Ah\", says Satan. \"You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted...\""

I'll use my Rolls Royce.\"  The banker, stunned, asks, \"A $250,000 Rolls Royce? Really?\"  The woman is completely positive. She hands over the keys, as the bankers and loan officers laugh at her.  They check her credentials, make sure she is the title owner. Everything checks out. They park it in their underground garage for two weeks.  When she comes back, she pays off the $5,000 loan as well as the $15.41 interest.  The loan officer says, \"Miss, we are very appreciative of your business with us, but I have one question. We looked you up and found out that you are a multi-millionaire.  Why would you want to borrow $5,000?\"  The woman replies,  \"Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?\""

Friday came and John went to her house at 2:00 p.m. After paying her $100 they went to the bedroom, had sex, and then John left.  Bill came home about 6:00 P.M. He asked his wife, \"Did John come by this afternoon?\"  Reluctantly, she replied, \"Yes, he did stop by for a few minutes.\"  Next Bill asked, \"Did John give you $100?\"  She thinks 'Oh hell, he knows!' Finally she says, \"Yes, he did give me $100.\"  \"Good,\" Bill says. \"John came by the office this morning and borrowed $100 from me.

I paid for it by selling hand jobs.\" So I shrugged and said \"What the hell, I need to live a little, I'll do it\" so we go back to my hotel and she gives me the best hand job I ever had.  She leaves and I pass out. The next night I go back to the same casino bar, and sure enough she's there again and I decide I wanted some more. I walk up to her and say \"You were amazing last night, how much would it cost for a blow job?\" She then smiles and says \"1 grand.\" Again I'm a little bit set back by the price and I said \"A grand? Is it that good?\" She then whips out her phone and shows me a picture of a HUGE, luxurious house. She then says \"See this house? I paid for it with blowjobs\" so I said \"Alright let's do it\" so this time we go into her car and she decides to blow me in the parking lot, and its the best blowjob I ever had.  We sit there and I'm blown away by this woman, so I ask her, \"how much would it cost for some pussy?\" She then laughs and points to the casino. \"You see that casino?\" I said \"...yeah?\" She says \"If I had a pussy, I would own that casino.\"  Update: Holy shit thanks for the gold. The comments have been awesome and the unexpected tranny attack its been a good day."

I thought I had been assigned to a terrible place.

He had stolen money from his parents; embezzled from  his employer; had an affair with his boss\u2019s wife; had sex with his  boss\u2019s 17 year old daughter on numerous occasions, taken illegal drugs; had several homosexual affairs; was arrested several times for public nudity and gave VD to his sister in-law.

This should klear up konfusion, and keyboards kan have one less letter.  There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year when the troublesome \"ph\" will be replaced with \"f\". This will make words like fotograf 20% shorter.   In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible.  Governments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling.   Also, al wil agre that the horibl mes of the silent \"e\" in the languag is disgrasful and it should go away.   By the 4th yer peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing \"th\" with \"z\" and \"w\" with \"v\".   During ze fifz yer, ze unesesary \"o\" kan be dropd from vords kontaining \"ou\" and after ziz fifz yer, ve vil hav a reil sensi bl riten styl.   Zer vil be no mor trubl or difikultis and evrivun vil find it ezi TU understand ech oza. Ze drem of a united urop vil finali kum tru.

Out at sea it doesn't take long for the fisherman to realize that the priest has no idea how to fish, so he gives him some quick instruction and shows him how to cast his bait out into the water. Within moments the priest manages to reel in the largest fish that the fisherman has ever seen. In the moment of excitement the fisherman exclaims, \"Look at the size of that Son-of-a-bitch!\"  Immediately the priest becomes disturbed and says, \"My son, please don't use such language.\"  The fisherman, embarrassed and hoping word of this gaffe will not reach the rest of his family, makes up an explanation in a moment of ingenuity, \"Oh no father, that's the name of that type of fish, a son-of-a-bitch.\" He lies, taking advantage of the priests fishing naivete.   The priest is pacified, and begs forgiveness for jumping to conclusions. The fisherman, relieved, brings the priest back to the docks and drops him off.  The priest lumbers back to the church, with the giant fish in his arms. Upon entering the church he sees the bishop and approaches him, \"Bishop, look at the size of this son-of-a-bitch I caught!\"  The bishop stands wide-eyed a moment, \"Priest, how could a man as holy as you use such language in the house of God?\"  The priest calmly explains that it is the name of the fish, and the bishop feeling embarrassed for jumping to conclusions offers to take and clean the fish for the priest.   After cleaning the fish the bishop takes it to the maid in the kitchen and tells her, \"Maid, I want you to cook this son-of-a-bitch for me.\"  The maid blushes and responds, \"Bishop, it may not be my place to say so, but is such language fitting for a man of your stature?\"  The bishop laughs haughtily, explains that it's the name of the fish and that he too had made the same mistake only minutes earlier. The maid laughs too, apologizes and cooks the fish.  It just so happens that the Pope decided to stop in for dinner at their church that evening. They are all sitting at the table when the pope says, \"Oh, my children, I know that gluttony is a sin but I simply can't stop myself from eating this fish. I must know, where did you get it?\"  \"I caught the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the priest.  \"I cleaned the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the bishop.  \"And I cooked the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the maid.  For a moment the pope sat silently, staring at them all wide-eyed. He then slowly removed his hat, kicked off his sandles, put his hands behind his head, kicked his feet up on the table and said, \"You know what? You mother fuckers are alright!\""

A few weeks go by, and the man only wabts to put his penis in the pickle slicer more and more, so he goes to his manager, to ask for help, and the manager refers him to an occupational therapist and gives him some time off.  Nothing helps though, the therapist refers him to a real psychologist, hoping that maybe they can cure this man's affliction.  So one day the man comes home to his wife and says with a sigh, \"Honey, I got fired today. I put my penis in the pickle slicer.\"  She gasps, crying out \"oh my god!

I feel great, actually.\"  His wife is now completely bewildered, \"But, bu--your peni- and the pickle slicer!?\"  The man shrugs, \"Yeah, she got fired, too.\""

I mean, you can give it a shot but I honestly doubt you can show me something that impressive.\"  So the man reaches into his left jacket pocket and pulls out a small hamster. He places the hamster on the bar and the bartender looks bemused. The man reaches into his other jacket pocket and pulls out a tiny piano, followed by a tiny stool, just the right size for the hamster, who sits down, cracks his knuckles and starts playing a famous piece of music by Rachmaninoff.  The bartender is speechless.  \"Tell you what mate... I've seen some things in my time but that is absolutely incredible! Here's your free beer.\"  The visitor gulps down his drink until the last drop is gone. But he can't help but feel another drink would really hit the spot.

But go on, try your luck then.\"  The man reaches into his left jacket pocket again and retrieves a small frog, who is wearing a waist coat. He places the frog on the stool beside the hamster. The hamster counts to four, the frog clears his throat, and over the piano the frog sings a classic opera, bringing several people in the bar to tears.  \"Oh my word,\" says the bartender. \"That is absolutely unbelievable. Here's your pint, mate. You've earned it.\"  In the corner of the room, a shady looking individual has been watching with keen interest from behind his dark sunglasses.

She decides that only her most experienced lady, Lola, will do. Lola has never said no, and it's not likely anything would surprise her. So the madam sends her over to Geoffrey's. They sit and talk, frolic a little, giggle a bit, drink a bit, and she sits on his lap. He whispers in her ear and she screams, \"NO WAY, BUDDY!\" and smacks him as hard as she can and leaves.  Madam is by now absolutely intrigued, having seen nothing like this in all her years of operating a brothel. She hasn't done the bedroom work herself for a long time, but she's sure she has said yes to everything a man could possibly ask for. She just has to find out what this man wants that has made her girls so angry. Besides she sees a chance to teach her employees a lesson.  So she goes over to Geoffrey and says that she's the best in the house and is available. She sits and talks with him. They frolic, giggle, drink and then she sits in his lap.

Husband #2 was in software services: he was never really sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he'd look into it and get back to me.  Husband #3 was from field services: he said everything checked out diagnostically but he just couldn't get the system up.  Husband #4 was in telemarketing: even though he knew he had the order, he didn't know when he would be able to deliver.  Husband #5 was an engineer: he understood the basic process but wanted three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.  Husband #6 was from finance and administration: he thought he knew how, but he wasn't sure whether it was his job or not.  Husband #7 was in marketing: although he had a nice product, he was never sure how to position it.  Husband #8 was a psychologist: all he ever did was talk about it.  Husband #9 was a gynecologist: all he did was look at it.  Husband #10 was a stamp collector: all he ever did was...   God! I miss him! But now that I've married you, I'm really excited!\"  \"Good,\" said the new husband, \"but, why?\"  \"You're a lawyer. This time I know I'm gonna get screwed!\""

The director of the winery wondered how to send him away. He gave him a glass to drink. The drunk tried it and said, \u201cIt's a Muscat, three years old, grown on a north slope, matured in steel containers. Low grade, but acceptable.\u201d \"That's correct\", said the boss. Another glass... \u201cThis is a Cabernet, eight years old, a south-western slope, oak barrels, matured at 8 degrees. Requires three more years for finest results.\u201d \"Correct.\" A third glass... \"It's a Pinot Blanc Champagne, high grade and exclusive,'' the drunk said calmly. The director was astonished. He winked at his secretary, secretly suggesting something. She left the room, and came back in with a glass of urine. The alcoholic tried it. \"It's a blonde, 26 years old, three months pregnant and if I don't get the job I'll name the father.\""

As they traveled through the hot desert looking for food and water, they gave up and sat down, thinking of what to do.  As the dust in the air settled, they suddenly could view a mosque ahead. They became very hopeful. But then John said ''Muslims are there. They might help us if we say we are Muslim.'' Then Mike said ''No way, I won't say I'm Muslim, I'm gonna be honest''.  So John and Mike went to the Mosque ahead and were greeted by an Arab Muslim, who asked what their names were.  John thought of a Muslim name and said, 'My name is Muhammad'. And Mike said 'My name is Mike'.  The Arab man said 'Hello Mike.' And told these other men to take Mike and give him food and drink.  Then he turned to John and said, 'Salaam Muhammad. Ramadan Mubarak! (Hello Muhammad, Happy Ramadan)"

But in the crowd, there was one scientist who wanted to impress everyone and thought of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he wouldn't be able to respond.   So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question.   The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.  The driver looks at him, dead in the eyes and says : \"Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.\""
